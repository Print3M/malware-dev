# Malware development

> **IMPORTANT**: The code is written and can be used only for the educational purpose!

This repository contains C/C++ snippets of code useful during Windows malware development. I'm trying to make every file standalone, hence some pieces of code might be redundant. You should always look at the standalone source file of a specific functionality.

A lot of techniques presented here and much more are described in [my malware-dev notes](https://print3m.github.io/notes) (`/windows/malware-dev`).
